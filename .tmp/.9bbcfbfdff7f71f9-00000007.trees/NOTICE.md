This project includes some code derived from
[@headless-tree/core](https://github.com/lukasbach/headless-tree).

The initial version of this project used `headless-tree` as the underlying tree
implementation. We have since written our own core at `packages/path-store`, but
many of the best ideas from `headless-tree` made their way to `path-store` and
`trees`. It's hard to identify exactly which code this is at this point, but
definitely things like the drag and drop implementation and the general list
approach to rendering and I'm sure more. The work that `@lukasbach` has
contributed to this space is greatly appreciated. `<3`
